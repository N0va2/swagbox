# Discord Jukebox Bot üéµ

A feature-rich Discord music bot built with Python that allows servers to create a shared music library. It supports both server-wide playlists managed by admins and personal playlists for every user, creating a collaborative and personalized listening experience.

This project was developed as a personal exercise to learn about asynchronous programming, real-time API integration with Discord, and relational database management in Python.

### ‚ú® Features

*   **Dual Playlist System:**
    *   **üë§ Personal Playlists:** Every user can create, manage, and play their own private playlists.
    *   **üåê Server Playlists:** Admins can create and manage curated playlists for the entire server.
*   **Audio Playback:** Streams audio directly from YouTube and other sources supported by `yt-dlp`.
*   **Persistent Library:** All playlists and songs are stored in a local SQLite database, so your library is saved even if the bot restarts.
*   **Queue Management:** Add single songs or entire playlists to the queue. Includes `!skip` and `!stop` controls.
*   **Intuitive Command Structure:** Easy-to-use command groups (`!p` for personal, `!s` for server) with helpful feedback.
*   **Role-Based Permissions:** Server playlist management is restricted to users with "Manage Server" permissions.
